## Getting Started

### Versions

- Python 3.10.4
- Django 3.2.12

----------

### Dependencies

- [django-cors-headers](https://pypi.org/project/django-cors-headers/), [djangorestframework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/), [psycopg2](https://pypi.org/project/psycopg2/), [gunicorn](https://docs.gunicorn.org/en/stable/run.html)

----------

### Using This Repo
This is a microservice designed to store data for and calculate user metrics for the One Minute Writer proejct app.

You can connect to this app and access the endpoints from https://enigmatic-oasis-75046.herokuapp.com/

See further documentation on accessing the [backend API](https://github.com/one-minute-writer/one_minute_writer_be) that consumes this microservice, and the user facing [frontend app](https://github.com/one-minute-writer/one_minute_writer_fe) in their respective READMEs.

----------

## Project Description

One minute writer is for creatives who are seeking inspiration and a space to document and organize their ideas and writing. They can track their progress through metrics on a user dashboard as well as revisit and edit past writings. This app was built with a cross-function team of 8 developers as the capstone proejct for graduation from the Turing School of Software and Design.

## Learning Goals for Project:

- Demonstrate knowledge gained throughout Turing
- Use an agile process to turn well defined requirements into deployed and production ready software
- Gain experience dividing applications into components and domains of responsibilities to facilitate multi-developer teams.
- Explore and implement new concepts, patterns, or libraries that have not been explicitly taught while at Turing
- Practice an advanced, professional git workflow including a Pull Request Review
- Gain experience using continuous integration tools to build and automate the deployment of features
- Build applications that execute in development, test, CI, and production environments
- Focus on communication between front-end and back-end teams in order to complete and deploy features that have been outlined by the project spec
